                      We understand the importance of freshness when it comes to your meals. That's why we've perfected
                      the art of meal delivery to ensure that every bite you take is as fresh and delicious as the
                      moment it was prepared. When you choose our service, your meals are meticulously packaged and
                      delivered with care. They arrive at your doorstep in an insulated cooler bag, complete with ice
                      packs that maintain a chilly temperature for an impressive 6-8 hours from the time of delivery
                      drop. This means your meals remain perfectly cold and safe for consumption even if you're not at
                      home when they arrive. To preserve the quality and nutritional value of your meals, we recommend
                      consuming them within 24 hours of delivery and storing them chilled, ideally below 5 degrees
                      Celsius. Our delivery vans are equipped with refrigeration units to ensure that your meals stay
                      fresh during transit. This dual-layered approach, combining insulated packaging and refrigerated
                      delivery, guarantees that your meals are not only convenient but also of the highest quality,
                      promoting your health and well-being with every delicious bite.

                      Aleen’s strives to make our meal delivery service as convenient and accessible as possible. We
                      deliver daily, except on Sundays, ensuring you have access to freshly prepared, health-conscious
                      meals throughout the week. Our delivery slots are designed to accommodate a variety of schedules,
                      and they depend on your specific location. Typically, deliveries are made between 2 a.m. and 8
                      a.m., giving you the flexibility to receive your meals when it's most convenient for you. We also
                      understand that you may have specific time requests, and we do our best to accommodate them based
                      on availability. To keep you informed and updated, we send you a notification once your delivery
                      is completed, providing you with peace of mind. In our commitment to sustainability, we’ve implem
                      ented biodegradable packaging. After enjoying your meals, simply keep the empty cooler bag with
                      the ice packs at your doorstep for courier collection on the second day of the delivery drop.
                      While we currently serve Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and Ajman, we're continually expanding our
                      reach. If we're not yet delivering to your area, rest assured that we're working hard to extend
                      our service to new locations.

                      No, you don't need to be at home to accept delivery of your carefully curated meal box. We
                      understand that your schedule may not always align with our delivery slots, and that's perfectly
                      fine. To ensure a smooth delivery experience, we recommend communicating with your building's
                      security team to grant access to our courier. Your health and convenience are our top priorities,
                      which is why we've designed our service to be as accommodating as possible. If you have any
                      specific delivery instructions or preferences, you can easily communicate them by placing notes in
                      the designated delivery tab or by reaching out to our dedicated customer care team. Rest assured
                      that your delicious, health-conscious meals will be waiting safely your doorstep, packed with care
                      and precision. We've taken every step to make sure you can enjoy your meals at your convenience,
                      whether you're at home or on the go. Your well-being is our mission, and we're here to make
                      healthy eating effortless for you.
